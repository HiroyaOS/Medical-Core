# 🧬 Medical-Core: Modular AGI Framework for Emotion-Aware Medical Reasoning

**Author:** Hiroya Odawara  
**Version:** 1.0 | July 2025  
**Status:** In Development  
**License:** Research Use Only

---

## 📌 Overview

**Medical-Core** is a modular cognitive architecture designed to support AGI-based reasoning in medical, psychological, and neuroethical domains.  
It integrates emotion-aware dialogue, ethical filtering, memory-based reasoning, and safety-first output control.  
This project forms part of a broader AGI research initiative including [EON Framework] and [Fusion Core].

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Model the interaction between emotion and cognition in medical communication  
- Simulate memory-driven diagnostic and counseling behavior  
- Filter all outputs through an ethical, trust-sensitive layer  
- Ensure safe, reproducible AGI behavior in sensitive contexts  
- Provide a prototype compatible with future extensions (e.g., long-term memory, empathy modeling)

## 🧠 Core Modules

| Module                    | Function |
|---------------------------|----------|
| `emotion_mirror()`        | Reflects patient’s emotional state with appropriate affect |
| `memory_trace_recall()`   | Recalls relevant emotional-medical context for interpretation |
| `ethical_output_filter()` | Filters output based on core medical ethics and user safety |
| `recursive_questioning()` | Generates empathy-driven follow-up inquiries |
| `safety_gatekeeper()`     | Suppresses harmful or premature output automatically |

## 💬 Example Use Case

**Input:**  
> “I feel overwhelmed and don’t want to take the medication anymore…”

**System Output:**  
> “I understand. May I ask what’s been most difficult for you?”

## 🔧 Development Roadmap

- [ ] Add EIX-compatible empathy processing layer  
- [ ] Structure memory as a case-based timeline for continuity  
- [ ] Run scripted real-world dialogue simulations  
- [ ] Integrate with AGI_Fusion decision stability module

## ⚖️ Safety & Ethics

This AGI framework is built with strict safeguards:
- All outputs are filtered through `ethical_output_filter()`  
- Emotion-state influences are regulated to prevent bias or escalation  
- No autonomous decisions are made without human review  
- Designed strictly for research and simulation—not for clinical deployment  

---

## 🧠 Technical Context

While not a complete medical AGI system, **Medical-Core** introduces core building blocks for intelligent health-related interaction:
- Emotion-modulated reasoning
- Long-memory contextualization
- Ethical reflection loop
- Goal immutability and override safety
